# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

```bash
# Compile the contract
npx hardhat compile

# Run the local Hardhat network
npx hardhat node

# Deploy the contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost

# Interact with the contract
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.ts --network localhost
```
